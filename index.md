## About Me

I am a tenured Associate Professor with appointments in both the [UCF College of Nursing](https://nursing.ucf.edu/people/rui-xie/) and the [UCF College of Sciences in the Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://sciences.ucf.edu/statistics/person/rui-xie/).

### Education

- **PhD in Statistics** from the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/)
- **MS in Statistics** from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/)
- **B.S. in Physics** from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/)
- **B.S. in Quantitative Finance** from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/)




## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Statistics/Biostatistics**, and **Nursing/Medical Science**, with a strong focus on health and nursing applications. We develop advanced statistical and AI-driven frameworks to analyze large-scale streaming data pertinent to healthcare and nursing practices. These innovative methods include statistical sketching and sampling techniques tailored to manage and interpret the vast amounts of continuous data generated in health and nursing environments.

The applicability of my work extends to numerous fields within healthcare, such as real-time patient monitoring, predictive modeling for patient outcomes, and optimizing resource allocation in nursing care. By collaborating with experts from various disciplines, including nursing science, psychology, computer science, and public health, we aim to address complex data science challenges. Together, I strive to enhance healthcare delivery and patient care through the integration of AI and statistical methodologies.
